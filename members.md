### Orestis Ousoultzoglou

Undergraduate student in School of Informatics, Computer Science Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece (freshmen year).

##### Introduction

Hey! My name is Orestis, I'm 18 years old and born in Veria, a small city in the west outskirts of Thessaloniki.
A passionate guy that firmly believes in the importance of indulging in constant retrospection and of continuously self-improving, as means of inspiring and liberating others.
Striving to grasp and integrate the notion of freedom in all aspects of my daily life, in conjuction with my strongly-coloured ideas about why holistic, multifaceted and unrestricted knowledge plays a pivotal role in society's prosper, were what led me to become greatly involved with the FOSS community.

##### Current Projects

 - Configuring Gentoo dotfiles
 - Hell Ascent & Lektochat, both of which are our team's projects
 - Providing oral tutoring on a Higher Mathematics Internal Assesment about musical instruments's timbre and Fourier Transforms for UCW
 - Writing an essay on Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit
 - Writing a publication on Cayley-Dickson construction
 - Building the foundations of an education programme meant to teach the essence of Complex numbers in Kindergarten
 - Several personal projects

##### Relevant Experiences/Achievements

I've attended various conferences, events and talks on subjects related to Mathematics and Informatics.
I've also been in two Summer Schools on Physics (Greek National Physics Society), four on Mathematics (Greek National Mathematics Society) and two (Center for Talented Youth, Johns Hopkins, USA) on Microeconomics and Math Modeling.
I've earned various distinctions in Greek National Mathematics contests across grades from K5-K11, and the CTY Greece Talent Search Award both times, for being among the highest scoring participants in the SCAT test.
Finally, I've co-held some presentations (mostly on topology), for example "Poincare's Conjecture and how Grigori Perelman solved it" on the International Mathematics Week (IFT, Thessaloniki).
I'm currently involved with informatics, although I had not had any prior experience on the field before my entering the CSd department here in Thessaloniki, so still a rookie in regards to that.

##### More

I get my hands into anything crossing my way, really.
The hobbies I've spent the most time on were piano training (2006-2018) and basketball (2006-2018).
I'm all about rainy nights, having interesting discussions and black coffee.
