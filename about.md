# Team Introduction

### Who We Are

Greetings! You've happened upon a great discovery!
This is our team: An association that consists of several like-minded, passionate students with one major common interest: **Free and Open Source Software**.
We all are members of the Computer Science Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh), located somewhere at Greece.

### What We Do

But what is CSD-FOSS-Team exactly?

First and foremost, this team is a means for interplay between creative people eager to share their craft, teach, learn and create.
We arrange meetings, join groups, hang out in coffee shops, you name it!
We hold presentations, join competitions and events, kickstart and build projects out of thin air..

It's not just that, however! We aim to further the Free and Open Source Community even more, be it by informing people about the various principles each FOSS advocate stands by, or by continuously inviting more to join us and bringing them on-board.

We also strive to contribute to the community; whether by creating and, thereafter, developing FOSS projects or by helping other developers in need.
Additionally, our goal is to make sure to render learning about and/or contributing to the community a simple and effortless process for everyone interested.
This can be achieved mainly through providing guidance as well as constant support, and by making sure this team is a welcoming place that incites one to stay and to actively participate.

As you can probably tell, there's no single, cookie-cutter answer to the above question. Instead, this team is of an ever-changing shape, structure and form.
Its priority? Ascertain that people can give to the FOSS community while maintaining and expressing their own traits and, above all, share their ideas and have fun!
